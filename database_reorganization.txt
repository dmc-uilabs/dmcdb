2 schemas: public and sqlj

sqlj has 4 tables, 3 sequences:
    classpath_entry
    jar_entry
    jar_repository
    typemap_entry
    
public has 249 tables, 184 sequences, 7 functions, 37 trigger functions 32 views

items need to be created in a particular sequence - so that references can be satisfied.

"main" script can be implemented as individual pieces like this:

BEGIN;
\i tables/common_shared_tables.psql
\i tables/user_info_tables.psql
\i tables/badges.tables.psql
COMMIT;

    Summary:
    Break script into parts (possibly in separate scripts):

        table creation
        add indexes
        add triggers
        add constraints
        Each script would get called by the master script.

Language handlers
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/plhandler.html
Based on this there should be a file called pljava that is the compiled version of the language handler.
